# Windows PE/RE Driver Loader v1.0.5
Load drivers in Windows Preinstallation Environment and Windows Recovery Environment.

## Notes
- This is not the same thing as https://github.com/YonatanReuvenIsraeli/WinRE-Driver-Tool as that only supports WinRE and the changes persist after reboot while this supports WinPE and WinRE and the loaded drivers only last until reboot.
